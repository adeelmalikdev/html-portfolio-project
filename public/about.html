<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Muhammad Adeel Tariq, a passionate and ambitious Computer Science undergraduate at International Islamic University Islamabad. I specialize in programming, data structures, and database systems, with hands-on experience in C++, Python, and Java. My enthusiasm for problem-solving drives me to seek out real-world tech challenges where I can apply my skills and continue learning.</p>

<p>Alongside my technical pursuits, I actively participate in university communities. As the Head of Membership & Outreach for Islamians Youth Club and Brand Ambassador for the Freelancing Society IIUI, I’ve led successful initiatives promoting freelancing, organized blood donation drives, and fostered student engagement through events and workshops.</p>

<p>I'm currently exploring new opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful projects. I believe in collaboration, adaptability, and continuous growth—values I bring to every team and project I join.</p>
